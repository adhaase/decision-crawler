# Dungeon Crawler
## Execution is determined based on your decisions! 

This dungeon crawler is a C++ automated decision game formatted as a classic level based simulation. The player (you!) starts is given 4 skill based attributes (Health, Attack, Agility, Luck) and given 25 points to add to the skill categories.

From there a simulation will run, and based on your choices the hero either lives to the end of the simulation (Floor 10 of the dungeon) or dies. Best of luck!
